Code Fix:


I have a Flutter app that is experiencing **severe performance issues**, including UI lag, skipped frames, and unoptimized rendering. I need an optimization tool or AI code assistant to **analyze my entire codebase** and make necessary improvements. 

### **ðŸ“Œ Key Problems in the Codebase**
1. **UI Freezing & Skipped Frames**
   - The app frequently logs: `I/Choreographer: Skipped XX frames!`
   - This indicates too much work is being done on the **main thread**.
   - Heavy computations, API calls, and unnecessary widget rebuilds may be slowing down rendering.

2. **Inefficient Widget Builds**
   - Some widgets **rebuild unnecessarily**, impacting performance.
   - I need suggestions to use **const widgets**, `ListView.builder()`, and optimized state management.

3. **Main Thread Overload**
   - The app runs heavy logic inside `setState()`, blocking the UI.
   - I need **recommendations to move CPU-heavy work** (e.g., JSON parsing, API requests) to background threads using `compute()`.

4. **Graphics & Rendering Issues**
   - I see repeated OpenGL errors: `E/libEGL: called unimplemented OpenGL ES API`
   - I need the app to properly handle **Impeller or Skia rendering** based on the device's capabilities.

### **ðŸ“Œ What the Optimization Tool Should Do**
1. **Code Analysis & Bottleneck Detection**
   - Identify slow UI components, expensive rebuilds, and inefficient widget structures.
   - Detect redundant state updates and suggest fixes.

2. **Refactor & Optimize Flutter Widgets**
   - Convert static widgets to `const` where applicable.
   - Optimize lists using `ListView.builder()` instead of unnecessary `Column` nesting.

3. **Async & Compute Optimization**
   - Move heavy computations **off the main thread** using `compute()` or isolates.
   - Optimize `FutureBuilder` usage and network requests.

4. **Rendering & GPU Optimization**
   - Fix OpenGL ES issues and suggest alternatives for **better GPU utilization**.
   - Ensure **smooth animations and transitions** by using `Transform` and `Opacity` efficiently.

5. **Memory Management & Garbage Collection**
   - Identify **excessive memory usage** from images, API calls, or widgets.
   - Recommend caching strategies for assets & network responses.

6. **Provide a Summary of Fixes**
   - Generate **detailed explanations** of optimizations applied.
   - Provide **before & after** performance benchmarks.

### **ðŸ“Œ Output Requirements**
- **A fully optimized, readable, and refactored codebase.**
- **Explanations of each optimization applied.**
- **Suggestions for best practices in Flutter performance tuning.**
